Overview

The PTL Material Flow System is a digital solution developed to enhance and oversee the movement of materials within an organization. It features five specialized portals, each dedicated to a unique phase of the material management process. For instance, the Receiver Portal facilitates the registration of new materials by capturing crucial details like Purchase Order, Invoice, and Docket Numbers, ensuring clear documentation and traceability at every stage.

Registers incoming materials (with PO, invoice, docket, gate pass, vendor info, and type), assigns handlers, generates OTPs and verification, and tracks status.

2. Handler Portal

Generates OTPs and verification , allocates materials to end users, coordinates transfers, manages OTPs, and updates statuses.

3. End User Portal

Collects materials (using OTP), performs quality checks, accepts or rejects items, manages quantities, submits feedback, and allows team leads to monitor assigned items.

4. Admin Portal

Manages users, master data, oversees system activity, generates reports, and maintains audit trails.

5. Dashboard Portal
